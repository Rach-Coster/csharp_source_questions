# csharp_source_questions
The following were the questions I was asked to do in C#: 

1)	The first should be a small sample of C# which shows your own personal coding style, it should demonstrate the use of some of the more common features in the language that you find useful. Please feel free to use code you have previously written for yourself.
2)	Below is a simple coding task. Could you please send us your solution to the following problem:
    “Write C# code to implement an efficient algorithm to create a 52 element array containing the numbers 1 to 52, randomly ordered. Each number should only occur once in the resultant array.
    Assume that you have access to a function called Random() that generates a random number in a specified range. This function will accept two parameters. The first is the LowNumber of the range and the second is the HighNumber of the range. The function will return a value that is >= LowNumber and <= HighNumber.”

For question one I am making a class called **The best of C#** which will include examples for both my favourite features generally in C# and my favourite feature in C# version 7.0.

This class will include: 
+ Garbage Collection
+ Local Functions *(New to 7.0)*
+ Turble Types *(New to 7.0)* 
+ Turble Literals *(New to 7.0)*
+ Switch Statements with Parameters *(New to 7.0)*
+ Polymorphism 

The repository includes both the .zip and the actual project folder for both questions. 

Please feel free to comment any feedback on how I can make this code better and I will attempt to do so.
